## Special Features

### 1. **Real-Time Auction Updates**

The platform uses a custom `useRealTimeAuction` hook that polls the server every 10 seconds, ensuring users always see the latest bid amounts, bidder counts, and auction status without manual refresh.

### 2. **Outbid Notification System**

The `useOutbidNotification` hook tracks when users are outbid and displays toast notifications, encouraging re-engagement and competitive bidding.

### 3. **Smart Bid Validation**

The system automatically calculates minimum bid increments based on current bid amounts, preventing invalid bids and ensuring fair competition.

### 4. **Middleware-Based Route Protection**

Custom Next.js middleware (`middleware.ts`) protects routes, enforces authentication, checks admin roles, and adds security headersâ€”all before pages load.

### 5. **Automated Auction Completion**

A cron job API endpoint (`/api/cron/complete-auctions`) runs periodically to:

- Find auctions past their end time
- Determine the winner (highest bidder)
- Check if reserve price was met
- Update auction status to "ended"
- Update user stats (wins, sales)

### 6. **JWT-Based Session Management**

Uses NextAuth.js with JWT strategy for:

- Secure, encrypted tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- No database lookups on every request (faster)
- Custom user properties (id, role) via TypeScript declaration merging

### 7. **Admin Panel with Full CRUD**

A comprehensive admin dashboard allows platform owners to:

- View real-time analytics (users, auctions, bids)
- Delete or suspend users
- Modify auction statuses
- Search and filter records
- Export data for reporting

### 8. **Responsive Design**

Built with Tailwind CSS, the entire platform adapts to:

- User's system theme preference (dark/light mode)
- All screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessibility standards (WCAG compliant)
